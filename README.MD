40L
===

Event based 40L clone for tetris.


I lost the source code for this (written in 2008).

Runs on Windows only; and crashes at the end :(


It has the following features:
* Customizable DAS
* Event-based
* Graphics only update on keypresses and events (like DAS expiring)
* 3 Previews
* Customizable controls
* TPM/KPT/Time
* Pretty stats display
* Hold Piece
* SRS rotation and wallkicks
